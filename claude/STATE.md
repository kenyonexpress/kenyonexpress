# KenyonExpress — Project State (autopilot branch pointer)

The canonical state file on this branch is the root `STATE.md`. This file
exists because the goal queue names `claude/STATE.md`; it holds the resume
line only, and the full block for each goal is in the root file.

המשך מ: G10 DONE

G10 (F11 club tiers): schema already applied as migrations/applied/282_club_tiers.sql (189 is taken by 189_affiliate_program), so no duplicate migration was written to pending. Editor at /admin/club-tiers (/admin/clubs redirects). Added public /club (src/app/(main)/club/page.tsx) listing active tiers + benefits, listPublicTiers() in src/server/queries/club.ts, sitemap entry.

המשך מ: G11 DONE

G11 (F12 affiliate): schema, per-campaign commission_bp (admin) snapshotted per order, wallet payout cron already live as migrations/applied/283_affiliate_campaigns.sql (188 is taken by 188_search_analytics, so no duplicate 188_affiliate.sql written). Added QR per link (urlQrDataUrl in src/lib/vouchers/qr-image.ts) and pending-earnings line on /account/affiliate.

המשך מ: G14 DONE

G14 (F15 passkeys + WhatsApp OTP): passkey register/authenticate routes already live (F12). OTP now 6 digits, 10 min TTL, 3 attempts (WA_OTP_MAX_ATTEMPTS, no migration: column allows up to 10). Meta Cloud API template send classifies template errors (132xxx, 131058) as templateRejected; only then the same code is emailed via Resend. Other failures send nothing. Removed the Supabase email-OTP branch from verify.

המשך מ: G16 DONE

G16 (F19 maintenance): flag, proxy redirect to /maintenance, and Turnstile on /checkout, /contact and /suppliers (/supplier/apply redirects there) already existed. Added /admin/settings with the maintenance_mode toggle (action takes an allowlisted return_to) and migrations/pending/190_maintenance.sql (idempotent, not applied).

המשך מ: G21 DONE

G20 (checkout address, shipping only): no billing address anywhere in checkout; first physical order saves the typed address to the profile and the 6th paid physical order is gated on a complete address + WhatsApp OTP (F42 gate, already live). New: migrations/pending/300_profiles_orders_physical_count.sql (profiles.orders_physical_count, backfill, service-role bump function; not applied) and finalize bumps it once on the pending->paid transition (best effort, gate still recounts from paid history).

G21 (Cardcom no billing address): src/lib/payments/cardcom.ts never sent billing-address, card-owner or issuing-country fields; no country filter exists in the payment paths. Added a guard test in cardcom.test.ts (33/33 pass). No production code change.

BLOCKED G23 perf below 95 on mobile-simulated Lighthouse (home 87, product 64, /c 56; a11y/BP/SEO 100, perf 100 with provided throttling). Fixed /club prerender build break + CSP wss for Supabase realtime. See docs/LIGHTHOUSE-FINAL.md.
