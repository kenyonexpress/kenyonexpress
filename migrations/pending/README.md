# `migrations/pending/`

Unapplied migrations. **Nothing in this directory has been run against any
database.** Nothing here may be applied with `db push` — the project forbids it.
The route to production is `apply_migration` through MCP, after Ofir approves
the file.

## This is now the only pending location

`supabase/migrations/` holds applied production migrations only. The three
`PENDING-` files that used to sit there were moved here on 2026-09-01 and
renumbered into the sequence below:

| was | is now |
| --- | --- |
| `supabase/migrations/PENDING-109-recurring-subscriptions.sql` | `135b_recurring_subscriptions.sql` |
| `supabase/migrations/PENDING-110-supplier-coordinates.sql` | `136_supplier_coordinates.sql` |
| `supabase/migrations/PENDING-money-integer-fix.sql` | superseded; the in-place path was deleted 2026-09-01, see DECISIONS |

Every reference to the old paths across `src/`, `apps/`, `docs/`, `scripts/`
and the root `*.md` files was rewritten in the same commit. There is no second
location left to read.

## Numbering

`120` and `121` were each used twice, in two directories, with two different
meanings. That is fixed: every file here was renumbered from **122 upward**,
skipping `128` and `129`, which are taken by
`supabase/migrations/128_wp_publish.sql` and `129_catalogue_cleanup.sql`.
Highest number applied in production is `129`. No number now repeats across the
two directories.

## RESOLVED 2026-09-01: the additive path (138-141) won. 142 is deleted.

Both convert money to integer agorot and they collide.

- **138-141 (recommended)** are *additive*: they add a `<col>_agorot bigint`
  beside each numeric column, `GENERATED ALWAYS AS (round(<col> * 100)::bigint)
  STORED`, so it can never drift from the column it mirrors. Applying them is a
  no-op for the running application, and they are reversible with a
  `DROP COLUMN`.
- **142** converts *in place*, renaming `total_ils` → `total_agorot` and
  changing its type. The moment it lands, every reader that still says
  `total_ils` breaks, and every reader that does not gets a number 100× larger.

They produce **9 identical column names** on the same tables, so applying 142
after 138-141 fails outright with "column already exists":

```
coupon_deals.original_price_agorot     products.compare_at_price_agorot
coupon_deals.platform_price_agorot     products.full_price_agorot
coupons.original_price_agorot          products.kenyon_price_agorot
product_variants.price_agorot          profiles.wallet_balance_agorot
product_variants.price_modifier_agorot
```

and a further 23 columns where the names differ only by an `_ils` infix
(`orders.total_ils_agorot` from 138 vs `orders.total_agorot` from 142), which
would leave the table carrying two agorot columns for one amount.

**Decision, taken 2026-09-01 and logged in `docs/DECISIONS.md`:** the additive
path is the production-safest option, so 138-141 are in the apply order and
**142 is parked**. It is kept, not deleted, because it is the only written
description of the eventual in-place end state, and because the decision to
abandon it belongs to Ofir.

### 142 was verified against production, and it is not a no-op

An earlier version of this file claimed production already stored money as
integer agorot, and that 142 therefore did nothing. **That claim was false.**
Measured against `ixvwfbuvfxxsjiywhbbb` on 2026-09-01, all **41** columns 142
targets are still `numeric` on real tables (`relkind = 'r'`); none is already
an integer, so none was removed from the file:

```
orders.total_ils        orders.subtotal_ils      orders.discount_ils
payments.amount_ils     payments.wallet_applied_ils
order_items.unit_price_ils  order_items.total_price_ils
products.price_ils      wallet_accounts.balance_ils    ... 41 total
```

The columns that *are* already integer agorot — `order_items.face_value_agorot`,
`vouchers.coupon_price_agorot`, `settlement_events.commission_agorot` and the
rest — are **different columns**, added alongside the numeric ones. That dual
representation is what made the earlier claim look true from a distance.

## The manifest

Blast radius is what breaks if the file is applied while the current code is
running. Order is the position in the apply sequence.

| # | File | What it changes | Blast radius | Order | Prerequisite | Rollback |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 122 | `122_deny_all_on_server_only_tables.sql` | Restrictive `using (false)` policy on the 5 server-only tables | **None.** RLS-on-no-policy is already deny; changes no effective permission | 1 | none | `drop policy if exists deny_all_client_roles on public.<each of the 5>;` |
| 123 | `123_products_whatsapp_enabled.sql` | `products.whatsapp_enabled boolean not null default false` + partial index | **None.** Defaults false, so no product changes behaviour | 2 | none | `drop index if exists public.products_whatsapp_enabled_idx; alter table public.products drop column if exists whatsapp_enabled;` |

| 125 | `125_expire_vouchers_drop_escrow.sql` | Replaces `expire_vouchers()`, dropping its last escrow branch | **Low.** Escrow model already abolished in 085; this finishes it | 4 | migration 085 (applied) | Restore the prior body from `supabase/migrations/085_voucher_scan_audit_and_no_escrow.sql` |
| 126 | `126_percent_range_checks.sql` | `CHECK (0..100)` on 12 unconstrained percent columns | **Low.** Fails at apply time only if a row is already out of range | 5 | none | `alter table public.<t> drop constraint if exists <t>_<col>_range;` (12 statements, listed in the file) |
| 127 | `127_homepage_cms.sql` | `banners`, `homepage_sections`, RLS policies, scheduling windows | **None.** Readers treat absence as normal and fall back to `src/lib/hero-singlefile-data.ts` | 6 | none | `drop table if exists public.banners, public.homepage_sections cascade;` |

| 132 | `132_search_index_outbox.sql` | `search_index_outbox`, enqueue trigger on `products`, `claim_search_index_jobs()` | **Low.** Adds a trigger to `products`; every product write now also writes an outbox row | 9 | none | `drop trigger if exists products_enqueue_search_index on public.products; drop function if exists public.enqueue_search_index(); drop function if exists public.claim_search_index_jobs(integer); drop table if exists public.search_index_outbox;` |
| 133 | `133_supplier_branches.sql` | `supplier_branches` table | **None.** Changes no money and no authorisation; a voucher still redeems against `suppliers.id` | 10 | none | `drop table if exists public.supplier_branches;` |
| 134 | `134_order_items_delivered_at.sql` | `order_items.delivered_at`, physical-only constraint, `order_item_cancellation_deadline()` | **Low.** Nullable column; the deadline function is new | 11 | none | `drop function if exists public.order_item_cancellation_deadline(uuid); drop index if exists public.order_items_delivered_at_idx; alter table public.order_items drop constraint if exists order_items_delivery_is_physical_only, drop column if exists delivered_at;` |
| 135 | `135b_recurring_subscriptions.sql` | `recurring` enum member, `subscriptions`, `subscription_charges`, 3 billing columns on `products` | **Medium.** `ALTER TYPE ... ADD VALUE` cannot run inside a transaction block and cannot be rolled back | 12 | none | Tables and columns drop cleanly; **the `recurring` enum member is permanent** — Postgres cannot remove an enum value |
| 136 | `136_supplier_coordinates.sql` | `suppliers.latitude`/`.longitude`, GiST index, pair CHECK | **None.** `supplierLocation()`'s exact branch is dead code until the columns exist | 13 | `cube` + `earthdistance` extensions | `drop index if exists public.suppliers_earth_idx; alter table public.suppliers drop constraint if exists suppliers_latlng_pair, drop column if exists latitude, drop column if exists longitude;` |
| 137 | `137_order_transition_guard.sql` | Status-transition guard triggers on `orders`/`vouchers`/`payments`, immutable `audit_log` | **Medium.** Constrains the service role, which every cron, webhook and repair script runs as. An illegal transition that used to succeed now raises | 14 | 130, 131, 134 (guards reference their statuses) | `drop trigger if exists audit_log_no_delete on public.audit_log; drop trigger if exists audit_log_no_update on public.audit_log; drop trigger if exists vouchers_status_guard on public.vouchers; drop trigger if exists payments_status_guard on public.payments; drop trigger if exists orders_status_guard on public.orders;` (+ the 6 guard functions) |
| 138 | `138_money_agorot_money_path.sql` | Adds a **generated** `_agorot` beside numeric on `orders`, `order_items`, `payments` | **None at apply.** Additive and unwritable.

| 139 | `139_money_agorot_wallet.sql` | Adds a **generated** `_agorot` on `wallet_accounts`, `wallet_balances`, `wallet_entries`, `wallet_transactions` | **None.** Additive. No `>= 0` check on balances: `wallet_accounts.balance_ils` has a live minimum of −1.80 | 16 | 138 | `alter table public.wallet_accounts drop column if exists balance_ils_agorot;` (+ the other 3 tables) |
| 140 | `140_money_agorot_catalog.sql` | Adds a **generated** `_agorot` on `products`, `product_variants`, `coupon_codes`, `coupon_deals`, `coupons` | **None at apply.** Additive. `price_modifier` stays signed — a variant may be cheaper than its base | 17 | 138 | `alter table public.products drop column if exists price_ils_agorot, drop column if exists coupon_price_ils_agorot, drop column if exists cost_ils_agorot, drop column if exists full_price_agorot;` (+ the other 4 tables) |
| 141 | `141_money_agorot_growth.sql` | Adds a **generated** `_agorot` on `affiliates`, `referrals` | **None at apply.** Additive. Both are cumulative earnings, so both take the non-negative check | 18 | 138 | `alter table public.affiliates drop column if exists total_earnings_ils_agorot; alter table public.referrals drop column if exists bonus_paid_amount_ils_agorot;` |

| `143_revoke_unused_definer_execute.sql` | Revokes `EXECUTE` on 5 SECURITY DEFINER functions from `anon`/`authenticated` | **Medium.** Closes a live RLS bypass in `voucher_success_payload`. `supplier_app_context` was withdrawn from this file — the Expo till calls it | 19 | `src/__tests__/revoked-functions-have-no-callers.test.ts` green | `GRANT EXECUTE ON FUNCTION public.<fn> TO anon, authenticated;` (5 statements, listed in the file) |
| 144 | `144_revoke_authenticated_dml.sql` | Revokes INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE from `authenticated` on the 8 RLS-on-zero-policy tables | **Low.** Defence in depth; RLS already blocks these, but RLS does not cover `TRUNCATE` | 20 | 122 (same 5 tables, policies first) | `GRANT INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE ON public.<t> TO authenticated;` (8 statements, listed in the file) |
| 145 | `145_revoke_check_rate_limit_execute.sql` | Revokes `EXECUTE` on `check_rate_limit` from `anon`/`authenticated` | **HIGH IF MISORDERED.** See below | **21 — LAST** | ⛔ **CODE-FIRST: commit `d5c2739d4`** | `GRANT EXECUTE ON FUNCTION public.check_rate_limit(text, integer, integer) TO anon, authenticated;` |
| 148 | `148_orders_monthly_partitioning.sql` | Converts `orders` to monthly range partitions on `created_at`; PK becomes `(id, created_at)`, 16 referencing tables gain a trigger-filled twin column and composite FKs | **HIGH.** Structural conversion of the busiest financial table; apply only in a maintenance window, details in the file header | after 137 | pg_cron (installed) | in file header |
| 149 | `149_soft_delete_user_facing_remainder.sql` | `deleted_at` + partial index + RLS select filters on `categories`, `product_images`, `reviews`, `wishlists`; splits `wishlists_owner_all` into four per-command policies | **Low.** Additive column; policies only narrow client reads. Service-role call sites are gated by `src/lib/soft-delete.ts`, whose pending list is flipped to live after apply | any | none | in file header |
| 169 | `169_audit_full_coverage.sql` | `audit_log` before/after/request_id columns, `entity_id` uuid→text, generic trigger v2 on every financial and user table | **✅ APPLIED 2026-09-04** via MCP as `audit_full_coverage_169`, on the explicit instruction of the /goal that requested it. Validated first against production inside a rolled-back DO block (snapshots, header capture, ip parsing all probed), then applied; 34 audit triggers verified after. The file stays here as the record, like 122-147 | any | none | in file header |
| 170 | `170_reporting_tables.sql` | 4 denormalized reporting tables (`report_revenue_daily`, `report_orders_daily`, `report_top_products`, `report_cohort_retention`), nightly `pg_cron` rebuild at 01:30 UTC, 5 admin-only definer RPCs gated on `is_admin()` | **✅ APPLIED 2026-09-04** via MCP as `reporting_tables_170`, on the explicit instruction of the /goal that requested it. Validated first end-to-end inside a rolled-back transaction (full refresh over real orders), then applied; row counts, the cron job and the 42501 deny path for a non-admin were verified after. New tables only, no existing reader | any | none | in file header |

## 138-141 add GENERATED columns, and that is what makes step 2 possible

The first draft added a plain `bigint` and filled it once:

```sql
alter table public.orders add column if not exists total_ils_agorot bigint;
update public.orders set total_ils_agorot = round(total_ils * 100) where ...;
```

Nothing kept it in step after that. No trigger, no default, no NOT NULL. The
running application writes `total_ils` and does not know the new column exists,
so **every order placed after the apply would have carried `total_ils_agorot`
NULL** — and step 2 of the cutover, rewriting the readers onto those columns,
is the entire reason the files exist. A customer who had just paid would have
been shown a total of 0.00, and the split would have settled a commission of
zero against it. The one-shot backfill made the migration look finished while
guaranteeing the step that follows it would be wrong.

All 32 columns are now:

```sql
alter table public.orders
  add column total_ils_agorot bigint
    generated always as (round(total_ils * 100)::bigint) stored;
```

which cannot drift: Postgres recomputes it on every insert and update of the
base column, and refuses any write that names it.

**Measured against `ixvwfbuvfxxsjiywhbbb`, PostgreSQL 17.6, not assumed.** The
generated form tracks insert, update and NULL, `-1.80` yields `-180`, and a
write to the generated column is refused with SQLSTATE `428C9`. The real DDL
for `orders.total_ils` and `product_variants.price_modifier` was then run
against the live tables inside a `DO` block that raises at the end, so it rolled
itself back:

```
DRYRUN_OK cols=1 backfill=[18.00->1800, 18.00->1800, 18.00->1800, 817.00->81700]
leftover_columns = 0
```

**Two consequences worth stating rather than discovering later.**

1. The non-negative CHECKs are no longer decorative. On a backfilled column
   nothing re-evaluated them; on a generated column they are validated on every
   write, so they now constrain the numeric column's sign at runtime. Every
   checked column was measured first and none is negative today, so the apply
   validates. The signed wallet columns still get no check.
2. **Step 3 is no longer a plain `DROP COLUMN`.** A generated column depends on
   its base column, so dropping the numeric one requires
   `ALTER TABLE ... ALTER COLUMN <col>_agorot DROP EXPRESSION` first, which
   turns it into an ordinary written column and keeps the stored values. This
   also hardens the exclusion with 142: 142's `ALTER TYPE` on a base column is
   refused outright while a generated column depends on it.

## ⛔ 145 is CODE-FIRST and it is one-way

**Required commit: `d5c2739d4`** — *"docs: מדריך הזנת דיל חדש (CONTENT-OPERATIONS-GUIDE) (#6)"*.
The title says docs; the commit also carries the change that matters here, in
`src/lib/utils/rate-limit.ts`:

```diff
-import { createClient } from '@/lib/supabase/server'
+import { createAdminClient } from '@/lib/supabase/admin'
-  const supabase = await createClient()
+  const supabase = adminClientOrNull()
```

Also required: **`8e26c3754`** (*"feat(rate-limit): a sliding window on Upstash
behind all thirty callsites, with Postgres as the fallback"*), which relocated
the Postgres fallback call into `src/lib/rate-limit/limiter.ts`. It is still the
same `createAdminClient()` call, so `service_role` still reaches the RPC — but
the callsite moved, and a check of the old path alone would now measure nothing.

Both are ancestors of `origin/main` as of 2026-09-01, so the prerequisite is
**merged**. What remains is that main is *deployed*: verify the running
production build contains `d5c2739d4` before applying 145.

**Why the order is one-way.** Apply 145 while a build older than `d5c2739d4` is
live and the RPC starts returning `42501` to a caller that is still `anon`. The
limiter's fail-open branch catches it, logs, and returns "allowed". Every rate
limit in the application — OTP, cart writes, checkout, search — turns off, and
the only symptom is a log line nobody is watching. That is strictly worse than
the hole 145 closes.

## Reference only — not in the apply order

### `the in-place money migration (deleted 2026-09-01)`

**NOT FOR EXECUTION. Superseded by the additive approach in 138-141. Retained as
the written specification of the eventual in-place end state. Do not apply.**

The same note now stands in the file's own header, so a reader who opens the SQL
without this README sees it too.

| # | File | What it changes | Blast radius | Order | Prerequisite | Rollback |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 142 | `the in-place money migration (deleted 2026-09-01)` | Converts 41 money columns in place, numeric ILS → bigint agorot; rebuilds `fn_wallet_transfer`, `fn_pay_referral`, 2 wallet views | **CATASTROPHIC. PARKED — DO NOT APPLY.** Mutually exclusive with 138-141; ~55 code files still read the old ILS names | — | Abandoning 138-141 **and** rewriting every reader first | Inverse rename + `ALTER TYPE ... USING <col> / 100.0`, plus restoring both functions and both views. **Treat as one-way in practice.** |

It is kept, not deleted, for the reason recorded in `docs/DECISIONS.md`: it is
the only written description of the eventual in-place end state, and the
decision to abandon it belongs to Ofir. `src/__tests__/pending-migrations-inventory.test.ts`
counts it among the files on disk, so deleting it fails that test.


## Apply order

```
122 → 123 → 124 → 125 → 126 → 127 → 130 → 131 → 132 → 133 → 134
    → 135 → 136 → 137 → 138 → 139 → 140 → 141 → 143 → 144 → 145
```

`142` is not in the sequence. It is parked and mutually exclusive with 138-141.

## Inventory is enforced by a test

`src/__tests__/pending-migrations-inventory.test.ts` checks both directions:
every `.sql` on disk appears in this manifest, and every `.sql` this manifest
names exists on disk. It also asserts `supabase/migrations/` contains no
`PENDING-` file, so the split location cannot come back.

`src/__tests__/revoked-functions-have-no-callers.test.ts` re-derives the revoke
list from this directory and checks it against every `.ts`/`.tsx` in **both**
`src/` and `apps/`, so revoking a function the Expo till uses fails a test
rather than a till.

## `149_soft_delete_user_facing_remainder.sql`, added 2026-09-04

Soft delete for the four user-facing tables that still lack it. Measured
against production 2026-09-04 over MCP: `products`, `product_variants`,
`suppliers`, `user_addresses`, `vendors` and `coupon_deals` already carry
`deleted_at` with RLS filters; `categories`, `product_images`, `reviews` and
`wishlists` have no such column at all. This file adds `deleted_at
timestamptz`, the house partial index, and rewrites the client-facing SELECT
policies so a deleted row disappears for shoppers while admin keeps it for
restore. It also closes a live gap: `product_images` were readable for a
soft-deleted product, because the old policy only checked
`products.status = 'active'`.

**The code side ships first and is safe either way.** Service-role readers
bypass RLS, so their filter lives in `src/lib/soft-delete.ts`, which keeps a
live list (filters now) and a pending list (no-op until this file is
applied — filtering on a missing column is a 42703 that kills the whole
query). After apply: regenerate types, and `src/lib/soft-delete.test.ts`
fails on purpose until the four names move to the live list.

## `148_orders_monthly_partitioning.sql`, added 2026-09-03

Found on disk unlisted on 2026-09-04 and inventoried then; written by a
parallel session. Converts `orders` to a table partitioned by range on
`created_at`, one partition per UTC month, provisioned twelve months ahead by
pg_cron. The primary key becomes `(id, created_at)`; each of the sixteen
referencing tables gains a trigger-filled `created_at` twin and a composite
FK preserving its ON DELETE semantics and constraint name. Global invoice
uniqueness moves to an `orders_invoice_numbers` registry table. Read the file
header in full before considering apply: it is a structural conversion of the
busiest financial table.

## `147_money_agorot_remaining_twins.sql`, added 2026-09-01

Generated `_agorot` twins for the last four money columns that had none:
`orders.discount_ils`, `orders.cashback_applied_ils`,
`order_items.supplier_payout_ils` and `order_items.cashback_earned_ils`.

They are the four that still convert in JavaScript, in
`src/lib/commerce/order-money-columns.ts`, on a value that has already crossed a
JSON boundary as a string. Everything else in the read path already reads a
twin and lets Postgres do the multiply against the numeric source.

`generated always as (round(<col> * 100)::bigint) stored`, like the 26 already
live: it cannot drift, and Postgres refuses any write that names it (428C9), so
no writer changes and the numeric column stays the source of truth.

**Dry run against production, in a transaction that was rolled back:** all four
were created, all four reported `is_generated = ALWAYS`, and the arithmetic is
right on real rows (17.10 -> 1710, 759.05 -> 75905). Confirmed afterwards that
zero columns of these names exist in production. The nonneg checks are safe on
current data, measured: minimums 0.00, 0.00, 17.10, 0.00, no negatives.

**No reader changes with it.** A select naming a column that does not exist
fails 42703 and takes the whole row with it. The reader moves in a separate
commit after this is applied.

## `146_wallet_balance_floor.sql`, added 2026-09-01

`check (user_id is null or balance_ils >= 0)` on `wallet_accounts`. A customer
wallet may not go negative; a house account may, because it is the funding side
of every cashback pair. The reasoning, and the measurements behind it, are in
`docs/DECISIONS.md`. The migration refuses to run if any user-owned account is
negative when it is applied.

## The 138-141 vs 142 question is closed

Ofir chose the additive path. `the in-place money migration (deleted 2026-09-01)` has been
deleted, not archived: the two paths produce nine identically-named columns on
the same tables, and a file left in a directory called `pending/` is a file
somebody may apply. The reasoning is in `docs/DECISIONS.md`.

## APPLIED IN PRODUCTION — do not apply again

Verified 2026-09-01 by querying the live database for each migration's own
effect, not by trusting this list. The version string is from
`supabase_migrations.schema_migrations`.

**`124_categories_sort_order.sql` is a different case.** `categories.sort_order`
exists in production, so the migration must not be run again, but there is **no
row for it in `schema_migrations` under any name**. The effect is present and the
record is not. Treat it as applied; do not expect to find its version string.

**Two of these needed a precise test, not a broad one.** A schema-wide count of
`authenticated` DML grants returns 144 and looks like `144` never ran. It did:
that migration revokes on a named list of eight tables, and against those eight
the count is zero. The 144 remaining grants are on ordinary catalogue and order
tables, which are protected by RLS rather than by revoking the grant. Measuring
the wrong thing here produces a confident, wrong "not applied".

**The fail-open hazard around `145` is closed.** `check_rate_limit` carries zero
EXECUTE grants for `anon` and `authenticated`, and the limiter runs on the
service-role client, so there is no still-anon caller left to fail open.

## Two files were corrected on disk so the repo matches production

Both were rejected at apply time and fixed during the apply. The versions in
this directory now describe what actually ran.

**`131_refunds.sql`.** `refund_due_by` was

```sql
GENERATED ALWAYS AS (requested_at + interval '14 days') STORED
```

which PostgreSQL rejects: a generation expression must be IMMUTABLE, and
`timestamptz + interval` is only STABLE, because the result depends on the
session `TimeZone`. It is now a plain `timestamptz` plus
`refunds_force_due_by()` on `BEFORE INSERT OR UPDATE`, with
`SET search_path TO ''`.

The guarantee is unchanged: nobody can extend the statutory deadline. What
changed is the failure mode. A generated column **refuses** a write to that
column with `428C9`; the trigger **accepts** the write and silently overwrites
the value. The verification note in the file was corrected to match, because it
still told a reader to expect `428C9`.

**`133_supplier_branches.sql`.** The member-write policy named `m.role`. There is
no such column: it is `member_role`, of enum `supplier_member_role`
(`owner`, `manager`, `scanner`). The applied policy also requires `m.is_active`,
and that addition matters more than the rename. Without it, revoking somebody's
access by clearing the flag would leave them able to write branches, because the
membership row still carries its role. Deactivation has to mean deactivation in
the policy, not only in the UI that stops drawing the button.

## `124`, `143`, `144`, `145` are out of the apply order

All four were confirmed applied in production under their old numbers, and they
sit in the APPLIED table above. `check_rate_limit` holds zero `anon` EXECUTE
grants and `authenticated` holds zero DML on the eight deny-all tables. **There
is no fail-open hazard left to sequence around**, which was the only reason the
apply order previously insisted `145` go last.

## 2026-09-01: two drifts between this directory and production, both closed

Found by querying the live database rather than by reading the migration record.

**`135` is two migrations in production, not one.** `schema_migrations` holds
`135a_product_type_recurring` and `135b_recurring_subscriptions`. The repo
carried a single combined file whose header argued, correctly, that PostgreSQL
17 permits `ALTER TYPE ... ADD VALUE` inside a transaction provided the label is
not used in the same one. The argument holds and the shape was still wrong: the
restriction binds the whole transaction, and nobody applying a later statement
can tell from reading it that `'recurring'` must not be referenced. Split into
`135a_product_type_recurring.sql` and `135b_recurring_subscriptions.sql` so the
constraint is structural instead of a promise kept by a comment.

**`138` describes eight columns; production has six.** What ran was a collapsed,
table-driven version of 138-141. These two were never created:

```
orders.discount_ils_agorot
order_items.supplier_payout_ils_agorot
```

The blocks that would create them are still in the file and still correct, so
running it would add them. Whether that is wanted is left open: the reason they
were dropped from the collapsed version was not recorded, and inventing one in a
migration header is how a wrong reason becomes a fact. A banner at the top of
`138` says all of this, so the file cannot be read as a description of
production without also reading the correction.

**The consequence for the application code.** Four money columns have no
generated twin and therefore still convert in JavaScript:

```
orders.discount_ils              orders.cashback_applied_ils
order_items.supplier_payout_ils  order_items.cashback_earned_ils
```

`src/lib/commerce/order-money-columns.ts` carries the same list at the call
site. The two have to change together.
